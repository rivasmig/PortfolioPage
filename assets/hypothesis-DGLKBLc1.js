# Hypothesis\r
\r
For our analysis, we watched the show Gravity Falls, well-known for its mysteries and continuity. We studied the foreshadowing within the episodes to split the episodes into four main categories:\r
\r
1. Prerequisites: Episodes with the most connections to later episodes and would need to be watched first to fully appreciate later episodes.\r
\r
2. Reliants: Episodes that have the most connections to previous episodes and would require having watched previous episodes to understand.\r
\r
3. Independents: Episodes with few connections and could be watched independently.\r
\r
4. Centrals: Episodes with many connections to past and future episodes and could not easily be watched alone.\r
\r
Based on our familiarity with the show, we predicted the following episodes as some to be the strongest representatives of their respectively predicted categories.\r
\r
| Prerequisites | Reliants | Independents | Centrals |\r
|---------------|----------|--------------|----------|\r
| Tourist Trapped | Not What He Seems | Roadside Attraction | Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future |\r
| Time Traveler's Pig | Weirdmageddon Part 3 | The Golf War | Dreamscaperers |\r
| A Tale of Two Stans | Gideon Rises | Double Dipper | Scary-oke |\r
| Society of the Blind Eye | Northwest Mansion Mystery | The Deep End | Sock Opera |\r
\r
We expect this data to tell us about the connectivity within a long-running series and how objective connections between episodes compare to the initial sentiment perceived by fans.`;export{e as default};
