## Analysis Results\r
\r
Taking the entire series into our data set and processing it, we mapped prerequisites, reliants, independence, and centrality using degrees out, degrees in, inverted degree value, and betweenness, respectively. Our hypothesis was only partially correct:\r
\r
### Correctly Predicted Episodes\r
\r
**Tourist Trapped, Society of the Blind Eye; Not What He Seems, Weirdmageddon part 3; Double Dipper; and Dreamscaperers**\r
\r
aligned with our original hypothesis chart; however,\r
\r
### Incorrectly Predicted Episodes  \r
\r
**The Time-Traveler's Pig, A Tale of Two Stans; Gideon Rises, Northwest Mansion Mystery; Roadside Attraction, The Golf War, The Deep End; Dipper and Mabel vs. The Future, Scary-oke, and Sock Opera**\r
\r
did not.\r
\r
## Accuracy Assessment\r
\r
This represents an accuracy of **37.5%**. Given the relative importance and unimportance of certain episodes to the plot, I think this calls into question the methodology of our analysis procedures, and specifically how [poorly] it aligned with our initial assertion. \r
\r
As it turns out, tracking random background references between episodes is not a good indication of the flow and progression of an episodic storyline. That being said, this dataset has resulted in a detailed compilation of foreshadowing, callbacks, and instances of continuity between episodes of Gravity Falls. One potential use for this data would be to determine what these connections of continuity can tell us about storytelling.\r
\r
## Future Research Directions\r
\r
To flesh out our research, we could additionally map out a new alignment chart specifically from the data we collected, cross-reference with other databases such as IMDB, graph linearly along the series' timeline, and even tie in out-of-series direct references such as the apocryphal print publications and graphic novels, Journal 3 and The Book of Bill, the shorts, the ARGs, and entirely separate shows like Rick and Morty and The Simpsons which tie directly or indirectly into the post-show plotline and Bill's revival.`;export{e as default};
