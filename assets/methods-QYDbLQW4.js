# Methods\r

The main method for analyzing and collecting our data was that we each watched through 10 episodes, looked at any elements that would foreshadow future events, paid attention to any call-backs or continuity nods that were featured within our 10 episodes, and integrated our findings into our data, which led to our conclusion.\r

We also looked at the Gravity Falls wiki page for any pieces of information that we may have missed. After tightening everything up, I'd say we managed to incorporate practically all the foreshadowing elements that are found within Gravity Falls and connected media.\r
