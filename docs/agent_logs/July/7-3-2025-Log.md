# AI Agent Log

**Date:** July 3, 2025

## üìù Summary of Changes

1. **OBJModel Component**
   - Added support for `.mtl` files via `MTLLoader` and `OBJLoader.setMaterials()`.
   - Cloned loaded model instances with `useMemo` to allow multiple renders.
   - Preserved Base3DComponent features and animations.

2. **ThreeCanvas Refactor**
   - Introduced hemisphere, ambient, and directional lights for richer illumination.
   - Enabled tone mapping (`ACESFilmicToneMapping`) and `sRGBColorSpace` output.
   - Added `disableSceneBackground` and `useCssBackground` flags to let CSS gradients show through.
   - Integrated skybox support via Drei‚Äôs `<Environment>`.

3. **LandingPage & Asset Loading**
   - Replaced primitive backgrounds with `GLTFCanvas` loading `palmtree.gltf` from `public/assets/scenes`.
   - Incorporated custom HDRI (`industrial_sunset_02_puresky_4k.hdr`) via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` for correct paths in both dev and GH Pages.
   - Added loading screen with `useProgress`, looping animations via `useAnimations`, and `animated` prop.
   - Demonstrated local image loading via public URLs; advised using `src/assets/` + `assetsInclude` for smaller inline assets.

4. **Gallery Page Rewrite**
   - Background replaced by `GLTFCanvas` with `littleTest2.gltf` and HDRI, served from `public/assets`.
   - Semi-transparent, backdrop-blurred cards matching LandingPage style.
   - Added back button to return to home.
   - Tag filtering, loading/error states preserved.
   - Asset URLs constructed using `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` for consistency across environments.

## üìö Documentation Updates

- **Architecture Overview**: Document `GLTFCanvas` usage, HDRI integration, and asset path strategy using `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
- **3D Workflow**: Outline exporting `.gltf`/`.glb`, enabling KHR lights/animations, and capturing cameras.
- **Asset Management**: Clarify when to place files in `public/assets/` vs. importing via `src/assets/` (with `assetsInclude`).
- **Page Templates**: Update code snippets for LandingPage and GalleryPage to use public asset URLs and `GLTFCanvas` props.

## üöÄ Current Status

- **Core 3D Loader**: `OBJModel`, `GLTFCanvas`, and optional `USDCanvas` are functional and tested.
- **Landing Page**: Fully operational with animated GLTF background, loader, HDRI, and UI overlay.
- **Gallery Page**: Live with 3D background, navigation, and filtering work correctly.
- **Performance**: Loader overlay hides initial load delay; mobile DPR and shader optimizations available.

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Export Docs**: Add instructions for Blender > GLTF including lights, cameras, and animation settings.
2. **Mobile Benchmarking**: Measure load times and FPS on low-end devices; tune `dpr` and LOD settings.
3. **Metadata Positioning**: Extend `GLTFCanvas` to read custom metadata (e.g., anchors or annotations) from scenes.
4. **Local Asset Imports**: Provide examples of bundling small images and textures via `src/assets/` imports and Vite‚Äôs `assetsInclude`.
5. **Error Boundaries**: Wrap 3D scene loaders in an error boundary component to display friendly fallback UIs.
