# CURRENT STATE - Portfolio 3D Engine

**Date**: July 3rd, 2025 | **Version**: v0.0.5 | **Development Phase**: Week 1

> **Week 1 Focus**: Landing page upgrade, OBJ file loading, theme system modularization

---

## 🎯 Current Development Goals

### **Week 1 Objectives**
1. **Landing Page Overhaul** - Enhanced 3D visuals and interaction
2. **OBJ File Loading** - Support for custom 3D models beyond primitives  
3. **Theme System Refactor** - Modular CSS architecture planning

### **Week 2 Preview**
- **Mini Physics Engine** - Wind simulation and basic particle effects

---

## ✅ System Status - What's Working

### **Core Architecture (Stable)**
- **Router.jsx** - Dynamic MDX routing system operational
- **Content Pipeline** - useMDXContent + mdxLoader.js processing .mdx files successfully
- **Gallery & Interests** - Both pages functional with tag filtering and content display
- **Card System** - BaseCard inheritance (ProjectCard/InterestCard) working cleanly
- **Theme Engine** - CSS variables + 3D material integration functional (pending refactor)
- **3D Foundation** - ThreeCanvas + Base3DComponent with mobile optimization

### **Content System (Production-Ready)**
- **MDX Processing** - Frontmatter parsing, tag validation, content filtering
- **3D Component Registration** - All primitives/wireframes/interactive available in MDX
- **GitHub Pages Deployment** - Hash routing preventing 404s on direct links
- **Mobile Support** - 3D components with performance optimization

---

## 🚧 Current Work In Progress (Week 1)

### **1. Landing Page Upgrade**
- **Status**: Planning/Design Phase
- **Goal**: More engaging 3D experience with interactive elements
- **Dependencies**: OBJ loading for custom models
- **Current**: Basic 3D background with rotating primitives

### **2. OBJ File Loading System**
- **Status**: Research Phase
- **Goal**: Load custom .obj models in ThreeCanvas and MDX components
- **Integration**: Add to mdx-components.jsx for use in content
- **Considerations**: File size optimization, GitHub Pages static hosting

### **3. Theme System Modularization**
- **Status**: Architecture Planning
- **Current Issue**: Single globals.css not scalable
- **Proposed**: `src/content/styles/` with separate CSS files per theme
- **Goal**: Better separation between CSS styling and 3D configuration

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Working Systems**
```
Content: .mdx files → mdxLoader → useMDXContent → Gallery/Interests
Theming: JS themes → ThemeEngine → CSS variables → Components
3D: ThreeCanvas → Base3DComponent → mdx-components → MDX content
Routing: URL → Router → Dynamic MDX import → Themed rendering
```

### **File Structure Status**

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### **Theme System**
- **globals.css** becoming unwieldy with multiple theme styles
- **CSS/JS separation** unclear - planning modular architecture
- **Theme switching** works but not optimized for scalability

### **3D System**  
- **Limited to primitives** - need OBJ loading for custom models
- **No physics** - static 3D elements only
- **Performance** - untested with complex models/physics

### **Content**
- **Missing sample content** - need more .mdx examples in projects/interests
- **3D integration** - custom models not yet available for MDX use

---

## 🎯 Week 1 Success Criteria

### **Must Have**
- [ ] Landing page with enhanced 3D experience using custom models
- [ ] Basic OBJ file loading working in ThreeCanvas
- [ ] Theme system refactor plan finalized

### **Nice to Have**  
- [ ] OBJ models available in MDX components
- [ ] Performance testing with complex models
- [ ] Initial modular CSS implementation

### **Stretch Goals**
- [ ] Model optimization pipeline
- [ ] Custom shader materials
- [ ] Advanced 3D interactions for landing page

---

## 🔍 Current Priorities (Order of Importance)

1. **OBJ Loading** - Foundation for custom 3D content
2. **Landing Page** - Main user entry point enhancement using custom models
3. **Theme Refactor** - Architecture improvement for scalability

---

## 📊 Development Metrics (Week 1)

### **Stability**: 🟢 High
- Core systems working reliably
- No breaking changes in production code
- Content pipeline stable

### **Feature Completeness**: 🟡 Medium  
- Basic functionality complete
- 3D model loading in development
- Theme architecture needs improvement

### **Performance**: 🟡 Unknown
- Mobile optimization present but untested with complex models
- Static hosting constraints understood
- Need benchmarking with OBJ files

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Research OBJ loading** - Three.js OBJLoader compatibility with Vite
2. **Landing page mockup** - Design enhanced 3D experience with custom models
3. **Theme architecture** - Plan modular CSS separation

---

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

- **Week 1 is focused** - OBJ loading and landing page enhancement only
- **Physics pushed to Week 2** - don't implement physics systems yet
- **Don't break working systems** - current architecture is solid
- **Focus on additions** - enhance rather than replace
- **Consider static hosting** - GitHub Pages limitations for file loading
- **Test mobile performance** - 3D enhancements must work on mobile

---

*Week 1 represents a shift from foundation-building to feature enhancement. The core system is stable enough to support advanced 3D features.*
